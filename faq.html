                                Here's how it works: if you want to be an officer, let one of the officers know you are interested. You will be on staff,
                                where you will help the board plan events. Figure out what position you want to be, and talk
                                to the officer who holds that position about shadowing them so you can learn more about their
                                responsibilities and their role. If you still want to be on board at the end of the school
                                year, elections will be held in Spring Quarter (more on that below). If you are elected to
                                a position, you are officially on board for the next school year!

                                Elections are held in the middle of Spring Quarter of the school year. When that time comes, you can apply for the positions
                                you want to run for (you can even run for multiple!). For each application, you must write
                                about why you believe you are the right candidate for that position.

                                <br> On election day, make sure to dress nice! All board members, staff, and candidates will
                                be present to listen to candidates give their speech. Other candidates running for the same
                                position will leave the room. After all candidates have given their speeches, everyone will
                                vote. If you are elected to a position, congratulations!

                                if you are a freshman or new transfer. You can make them drive you around (if they have a
                                car) and even make them pay for your meals! Getting a big is a great way to meet new friends,

                                A family consists of a few officers and regular members who want to be part of a small, tight-knit group of people in CASA.
                                There are usually a couple of families who have their own unique names. Each family will
                                have their own events, where members can bond with officers and vice versa. This helps promote

                                <br>
                                <br> Every year, we have intercollegiate events at different campuses throughout the school year.
                                Some of these events include All Staff (games), CHF (games and performances), All-Cal (clubbing
                                and dance competition), and many more. It is always a blast to meet people from other schools,
                                so we hope you get the chance to experience the fun!

                                Being one of CASA's sponsors has many benefits. First, it's free advertisement! There's no cost from your business, and we
                                promote your business through images on the website and at GBMs. Sometimes, we will have
                                an event where we choose a restaurant to eat/drink or a business to host an event. All you
                                have to do is choose a discount you want to give to those who show the CASA Membership Card
                                at your business!
