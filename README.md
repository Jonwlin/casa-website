# casa-website

Through taking apart the old website and online guides, I learned the HTML and CSS necessary to create my ideal website for the club I was part of. 

I used inspirations from websites I admired to style and organize the website to be easy to navigate and pretty. I really enjoyed the process of learning a front-end language and deploying something my friends and family could critique.
